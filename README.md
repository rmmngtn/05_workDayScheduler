# 05_workDayScheduler

This project creates a simple calendar application that runs in browser, and allows the user to save their schedule within specific hour time blocks, and coordinating the current date, the hours of the day, and their status using Moment.js. 
As the hours of the day pass, the time blocks change color to correspond with the work hours and tasks left to accomplish. 
As the scheduler is edited, and tasks are added or removed, these items are saved and recalled from a user's local storage with the click of a save button. 

This code utilizes HTML and CSS, dynamically powered and altered with jQuery.
